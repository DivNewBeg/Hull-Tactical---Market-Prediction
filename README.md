This project originates from a competition that was hosted on Kaggle by Hull Tactical.
The following are the relevant details for this competition: -
1) Competition name:             Hull Tactical - Market Prediction
2) Competition duration:         Sep 16, 2025 - Dec 15, 2025
3) Competition URL:  	         https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hull-tactical-market-prediction/overview

Project artefacts: -
1) LSTM Model.ipynb:            This Python notebook contains an LSTM model to predict market returns. However, LSTM models were not found to be the most
                                the most appropriate for market returns prediction task. This was, therefore, not used as the final submission.

2) Feed Forward.ipynb:          This Python notebook contains a simple feed-forward neural network to predict market returns. This was used as the final 
                                submission for this competition.
